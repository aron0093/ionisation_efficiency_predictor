Peptide abundances provided in supplementary data from,

Bo Zhang, Mohammad Pirmoradian, Roman Zubarev, and Lukas KÃ¤ll *Covariation of Peptide Abundances Accurately Reflects Protein Concentration Differences* Mol Cell Proteomics 2017 16: 936-948. First Published on March 16, 2017, doi:[10.1074/mcp.O117.067728](http://www.mcponline.org/content/early/2017/03/16/mcp.O117.067728/suppl/DC1)

Data was processed using the data_cleaning.py script with the default parameters.

**Note:** The sample data is useful for understanding the operation of the scripts. It does not generate a very useful model. The model requires large amount of data from diverse experimental conditions to achieve good training and validation accuracy!
